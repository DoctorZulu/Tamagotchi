# tomagatchi
Web based tomagatchi clone

/* User Story */

1. Game Object
    This browser based program will be a scaled down clone of the original Tomagatchi toy from Japan. There will be a small central mock LCD screen that will display the status of the 'gatchi. There are three buttons that will cause different interactions during the stages of life. Ultimately the goal is for the user to keep the 'gatchi alive and happy during the lifecycle (10 mins) and successfully evolve to the final life-stage

2. Gameplay
    The user will encounter a screen with an unhatched egg. The game begins when the user clicks the eggs. Life stages are as follows egg=>child=>teenager=>adult=>old. Evolution to the next life stage depends on keeping the pet alive for a certain amount of time and fulfilling certain requirements ex. fed, happiness, and sleepiness. If the pet hasn't evolved fully before the timer is up, the user loses, if the pet dies at any point before timer is up the user loses. If all stages are successfully reached in the time period and pet is kept alive the user wins.

    There will be little to no text interaction to mimic the original ambiguity of the game and frustration that original game users felt when trying to raise their 'gatchi.

3. Game design
    The UX will be simplistic with three buttons below the mock LCD screen. Time permitting the LCD will be encased in a handheld style css styled container similar to the original Tomagatchi egg shape.
