Web based tomagatchi clone

/* User Story */

1. Game Object
    This browser based program will be a scaled down clone of the original Tomagatchi toy from Japan. There will be a small central mock LCD screen that will display the status of the 'gatchi. There are three buttons that will cause different interactions during the stages of life. Ultimately the goal is for the user to keep the 'gatchi alive and happy during the lifecycle (10 mins) and successfully evolve to the final life-stage
